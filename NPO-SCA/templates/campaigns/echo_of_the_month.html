      <p>Each month, our "Echo of the Month" shines a spotlight on an important mental health topic, such as Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD), Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD), or Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). This educational series exists to break down stigma and build a more informed, empathetic community, because awareness is the first step to connection. Through informational posts and videos, we provide clear and compassionate explanations of different mental health conditions, helping to demystify these topics, validate personal experiences, and remind everyone that no one has to face these challenges alone.</p>
