      <p>This series connects seasonal events, holidays, and official awareness days (like World Mental Health Day) to your mental well-being. Holidays can bring a mix of joy and pressure, so these posts provide timely support and acknowledge the unique challenges that can accompany them. We share messages of gratitude, tips for inclusive and low-stress celebrations, and reminders to check in with yourself and others. This series helps reframe these events around connection and well-being.</p>
