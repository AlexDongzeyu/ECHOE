        <!-- Section Introduction -->
        <div class="section-intro">
            <p>We believe in the power of lived experience to create connection. This section features the voices and
                experiences of students in our community — sharing their struggles, their triumphs, and their unfiltered
                thoughts. By showcasing real stories, we remind every student that while their journey is unique, they
                are never walking it alone.</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 16px;">Research consistently shows that knowing others share similar experiences
                reduces feelings of isolation and normalizes help-seeking behavior. When students see their peers
                talking openly about mental health challenges, they're more likely to recognize their own struggles as
                valid and reach out for support. Our Student Voices content creates this crucial sense of shared
                experience.</p>

                <h2>Echo Voices</h2>
                <p class="campaign-tagline">"Connection is Protection"</p>
                <p>Every face in the hallway has a story you haven't heard. Echo Voices is our signature interview
                    series featuring students from different grades and backgrounds. We ask the real questions: When do
                    you feel most alone? What gives you hope? How do you cope when things get hard?</p>
                <p>Through honest portraits and candid interviews, these stories serve as our strongest protection
                    against isolation. Participants share what mental health means to them, moments when they felt most
                    connected or disconnected, and advice for others who might be struggling. The diversity of voices —
                    representing different experiences, challenges, and coping strategies — ensures that every student
                    can find someone whose story resonates with their own.</p>
                <p>Featured students have shared experiences ranging from navigating social anxiety to processing family
                    challenges, from the isolation of being an international student to the pressure of academic
                    expectations. Each story is a reminder that vulnerability creates connection, and that speaking our
                    truth can help others feel less alone.</p>

                <p class="campaign-tagline">"When Feelings Speak"</p>
                <p>Sometimes, emotions are too complex for words. The Echo Gallery showcases creative submissions from
                    our community — art, photography, poetry, and visual expressions of mental health. It is a safe
                    space where creativity meets vulnerability, allowing students to see their internal worlds reflected
                    in the art of others.</p>
                <p>Art has long been recognized as a powerful tool for emotional expression and processing. For students
                    who struggle to articulate their feelings verbally, creative expression offers an alternative
                    pathway to be heard and understood. The Echo Gallery celebrates these expressions and creates
                    opportunities for connection through shared aesthetic experiences.</p>
                <p>We accept submissions on an ongoing basis and feature selected works across our social media
                    platforms and website. All submissions are shared with artist permission, and participants can
                    choose to remain anonymous or be credited for their work.</p>

                <p>Words have the power to heal. Our Letter Writing Contest invites students to pen anonymous letters —
                    to themselves, to a friend, to a stranger who needs hope, or to their community. Writing allows for
                    reflection and processing that may not happen in everyday conversation.</p>
                <p>Letters can address any aspect of mental health: what you've learned from difficult experiences, what
                    you wish someone had told you, what gives you hope, or what you want others to know about struggles
                    they may not see. The most meaningful entries receive special E.C.H.O.E. mental wellness prize
                    boxes, and selected letters may be shared (anonymously) to inspire others and demonstrate the power
                    of authentic expression.</p>
