        <p>Donations made through E.C.H.O.E. are directed to related charities and community partners aligned with our mission — including youth mental health, crisis support, and community connection initiatives.

        <ul>
            <li>Partner charities advancing youth mental health and crisis support</li>
            <li>Community groups fostering belonging and social connection</li>
            <li>Essential program needs that enable outreach and events</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Every contribution — large or small — helps reduce isolation and amplify voices that deserve to be heard.</p>
